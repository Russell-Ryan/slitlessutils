	cosmic ray
		A high energy particle that imparts a significant amount of charge.  Cosmic rays often appear as very sharp, discontinuous features that do not reappear in successive images.

	data-quality array

	direct imaging
	    

	grism
	    A transmissive and dispersive spectral element that often has a (nearly) constant 

	master-sky image


	pick-off mirror
	    An optical element that redirects the light to the instrument in question. 

	post-imaging


	pre-imaging


	prism

	spectral dispersion

	spectral trace

	undispersed position
	    The position a source would have in the absence of the spectral grating: :math:`(x_0,y_0)`.  Importantly, this is **not** equivalent to the zeroth-order spectral trace.

	wedge offsets
		Positional offsets due to the variations in the thickness of the optical elements (see `Sabbi 2012 <https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2012/WFC3-2012-01.pdf>`_).
