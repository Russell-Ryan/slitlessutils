Regions Files for ``ds9`` (`~slitlessutils.modules.Region()`)
=============================================================

It is occasionally useful to render the two-dimensional WFSS image with spectral traces marked.  For this, ``slitlessutils`` has the ability to distill the PDT files into a `ds9 <https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9>`_ region file.  



`polygon regions <https://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html>`_


``tab20`` colormap (bold colors are positive orders, pastel colors are negative orders) with the zeroth order in white.
